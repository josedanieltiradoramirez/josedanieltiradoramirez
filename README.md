## 👋 About Me

I'm Daniel, a Software Developer experienced in Python and C#.

One of my most significant projects (2023) was contributing to a virtual reality research initiative at the Université de Montréal focused on vision recovery. I participated in the development of a VR environment built with Unity and Blender, where I implemented real-time functionality and interface logic in C#. The system integrated a treadmill device to synchronize real-world movement with a virtual environment.

More recently, I have been developing desktop applications using PyQt and SQLite, building structured, business-oriented solutions such as a restaurant order management system.

I am currently expanding my expertise in backend development and software architecture, aiming to design scalable and maintainable systems.
